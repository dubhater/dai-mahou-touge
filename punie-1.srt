1
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,054
Punie, listen to me very carefully.

2
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,351
Yes, Mama.

3
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:29,422
Starting today, you're going
to spend a year living on Earth.

4
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,693
I'm sure there will be many
difficult tasks ahead for you.

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,634
But you must find a way
to overcome those things. Because...

6
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:41,104
If you get lonely,
you can always come back...

7
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,869
No need to say
such unnecessary things.

8
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,136
Oh, but I'm fine.

9
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,774
I mean, this is a test
to become the next queen!

10
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,443
Now, that's my daughter.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,880
Punie!

12
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,956
I'm going now, Papa, Mama.

13
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,357
Go!

14
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:16,405
I'm Punie Tanaka, a transfer from
Saint Magic Academy up in the sky!

15
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,077
Nice to meet you!

16
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,079
Anego.

17
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,292
I don't like it.

18
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,592
Seducing men like
that and being conceited.

19
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,400
That's the type I hate the most.

20
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:52,102
Should we teach her a good lesson?

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,972
Ashtray.

22
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,047
Mind your own business.

23
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,618
I'll do it myself!

24
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,353
Hey, you need to keep it quiet.

25
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,829
Shut up!

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,428
Ouch...

27
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,000

What a perfectly clear sky!

44
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,107
Earth is such a really clean place!

45
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,541
I really like this place!

46
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:14,621
So cute...

47
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,486
So cute...
She's so innocent.

48
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,116
These beautiful
forests, land, and skies.

49

the queen, they'll all be mine!

50
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,435
Hey, what are you
grinning about? You disgust me.

51
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,740
Making eye contact with
the guys and getting their attention.

52
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,741
You must be very pleased, miss.

53
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,812
Oh, that was a charm spell.

probably use a wonderful charm.

57
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,028

Stop picking on Punie-chan!

62
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,274
Take that!

63
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,984
Anego, they're pretty tasty.

64
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,542
Anego, they're pretty tasty.
I'm still raw!

I'll establish a magic school here.

our food sanitary. This can't be...

84
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,237
There must be
some misunderstanding!

85
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,747
This was in your curry!

86
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,817
All right, trash this place!

87
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,755
Yeah!

88
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,382
Yeah!
What'll you trash?

89
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,050
You know. We'll turn
this place upside down...

91
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,024

00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:46,899
Let's go!

93
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:47,988
Right.

94
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,095

00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,508

As a result, no one buys from us.

99
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,910
I'm sorry to hear that.

How is the taste, miss?

108
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,607
Get me the store owner.

109
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,776
This isn't curry.

110
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,047
It's yellow feed.

111
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,917
So mean!

112
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:52,054
The temperature, quality, and spices'
scent... Aren't they the same as ever?

113
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:55,497
If you made it according
to recipe, it's just ridiculous.

114
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,128
It's a typical, awful curry
made by an amateur.

115
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,762
Hey, hey, hey!

116
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,206

Lyrical Tokarev, kill them all!

118
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,153
You don't have to depend
on popular spices.

119
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,822
You love the railroad, so there's
a curry only you can make.

120
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:30,062
A curry that only I can make?

121
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,802
I know. I can use that method.

122
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,937
Boss, it'll work if it's that.

123
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,778
You're right.
Let's do a good job, everyone.

124
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,248
Yeah!

125
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:50,089

Should I go fetch a few?

129
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,765
Why don't you try some curry?

130
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,807
It's really good though.

131
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,297
It's really good though.
Does this mean...

132
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,708
...that we're not maidens?

133
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,804
What are you saying?
You're one fine maiden!

134
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,213
You made such good curry.

135
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,182
Damn... If it wasn't
for that magical pendant...

136
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:28,391
I see. So that magical
pendant is getting in your way?

137
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,795
Who're you?

138
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,455
If you're in here,
you better order something.

139
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:39,435
What if I told you this statue of the evil
god Anisakis could inhibit her magic?

140
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,274
If she had no magic,
we wouldn't be afraid of her.

141
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:47,335
We'd give her a beating and send
her back to the land of magic.

142
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,643
Is that right? Then I shall give you this.

143
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,181
Okay.

144
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,187
Bad news!
The railroad-research curry is...

145
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,717
Give me some curry!

146
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,916
Hurry!

147
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,553
What's going on?

148
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:09,429
This seems like ordinary curry,
but what is this strange nostalgia?

149
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:14,206
This container isn't an ordinary one...
Seven hundred... Three hundred...

150
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,067
This is...

151
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,075
The old bullet train!

152
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,508
Yes, this is the long-lost flavor
of the bullet train buffet curry!

153
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:27,515
But this isn't just a recreation!
The stars are these vegetables!

154
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,156
How fresh and juicy!
These vegetables are alive!

155
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,321
The vegetables are alive?
Not good. Where are they making it?

00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,558
You know! Did you forget
how I take care of things?

158
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,200
Can we become delicious curry?

159
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,869
Well, let's go!

160
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,173
Yeah!

161
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,975
What's wrong?

162
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,643
I'm kind of afraid to jump in...

163
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,614
Shameful... Bring me the peeler!

164
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,848
Yes, sir!

165
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,193
Isn't this the time to repay
Punie-sama for her great gratitude?

166
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,422
Why should you hesitate?

167
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,795
He's peeling his own skin!

168
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,798
Carrot-dono, I'm sorry,
but where is the pot?

169
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,706
You can't see?

170
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,939
Carrot-dono, we veggies
have to show mercy.

171
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,349
Sorry!

172
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,955
See you later.

173
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:36,956
See you later.
Potato-dono!

174
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,753
Potato-dono!

175
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,452
We'll be joining you shortly!

176
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:47,123
The vegetables really are alive.
She's a witch after all...

177
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,263
I'll destroy them. This curry is evil!

178
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,037
Please don't do that.

179
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:52,833
Please don't do that.
Punie!

180
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,999
I'll have to use a punishment
spell on people like you.

181
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,839
Lyrical Tokarev, kill them all!

182
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,969
Take this!

183
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,916
That's a statue of Anisakis!
Where'd you get that?

184
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,680
That's none of your business.
I suppressed your magic now.

185
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,653
Gang, beat her up!

186
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,053
Yeah!

187
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,786
What should I do?
I can't use my Princess Rod.

188
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,563
Then...

189
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,326
Then...
I'll give you some pain!

190
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:23,326
Then I'll have to respond
by getting physical!

191
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,663
Die!

192
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,004
Princess Arm Lock!

193
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,142
You little bitch!

194
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,008
Princess Choke Sleeper!

195
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,044
Princess Foot Lock!

196
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,446
Princess Americana!

197
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,418
Princess Guillotine Choke Sleeper!

198
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,083
W-What's with those simple
but painful-looking moves?

199
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,527
Striking...

200
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,266
Striking is unnecessary in a fight.

201
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:56,735
Effective

202
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,804
Effective
A champion uses submission holds.

203
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,771
A champion uses submission holds.

204
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,368
Princess...

205
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,709
No! I don't like painful ones!

206
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,648
...Achilles Hold!

207
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,224
Oops, I did it again.

208
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,463
I knew a girl gang leader couldn't do it.

209
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,062
Stopping the trials is hard.

210
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,171
Oh, what's wrong?

211
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,973
We can't sell any of our baked squid.

212
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,570
I'm sorry!

213
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,777
Leave it to me. I'll give you
the best baked squid in the world.

214
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,380
Lyrical Tokarev, kill them all!

215
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,791
It's a monster squid!

216
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,952
It's a monster squid!
My son's still in the building!

217
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,220
Help me!

218
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,454
Boss!

219
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:00,923
Oops.

220
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:09,030
No, I'll be late. Watching "Goodbye,
Blue Train Morning Breeze, Sakura"...

221
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,176
...on DVD so late was a mistake.

222
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,370
...on DVD so late was a mistake.
Excuse me...

223
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,079
Sorry, I'm in a rush!

224
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,877
Sorry, I'm in a rush!
Do you have anything to eat?

225
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,910
Oh no! Take my special
"assorted bento from the peak."

226
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,011
Wow!

227
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,847
Delicious, paya!

228
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,554
Thank you, paya.
I don't know how to thank you.

229
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,062
You're welcome.

230
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,632
Pa
I'm Payatan.

231
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,361
Pa
I'm from the land of magic.

232
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,268
Magic?

233
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,394
Magic?
Right, paya.

234
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,937
I came to find my master, paya.

235
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,098
Good morning, Tetsuko-chan!

236
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,075
Good morning.

237
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,168
Good morning.
P-P-Punie-sama!

238
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,245
Payatan!

239
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,580
Punie-sama!

240
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,514
Punie-sama!
Payatan!

241
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:57,354
Why did you leave without saying
a word? Don't you like me anymore?

242
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,157
It's not like that, Payatan.

243
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,160
It was hard to say goodbye,
so I left without a word.

244
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,555
Punie-sama!

245
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,096
Payatan!

246
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:11,659
<i>Episode 2: Playful and
Cute Mascot Payatan Appears!!</i>

247
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:16,264
So a mascot always stays with
the witch in the land of magic?

248
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,364
Right, paya.

249
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,934
But you shouldn't have
followed me when I'm in training.

250
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,139
Mama might get mad at you.

251
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,445
It's fine, paya.
I want to be with you even so.

252
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,519
Jeez.

253
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,017
You two get along very well.

254
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,149
I want a mascot like Payatan too.

255
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,389
You should go to Exciting Mascot
Village. Many of my friends are there.

256
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,327
"Exciting Mascot Village"?
Sounds like fun!

257
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,829
I still remember when I went to see
Payatan at Exciting Mascot Village.

258
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,907
Paya.

259
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,867
<i>Exciting Mascot Village</i>

260
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,220
Go away!
You're obstructing my business!

261
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,184
There! All right, 4, 5, 6!

262
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,661
And this broad was really something.

263
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,298
Who the hell are you?

264
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,841
I came to get a mascot.

265
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,874
A mascot! I didn't know
dumb witches were around!

266
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,850
There's no one here
that you can handle.

267
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,978
Did you mix this up with
the south's "Cheery Mascot Village"?

268
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,217
This place is only full of guys like us!

269
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,784
Ow, ow, ow...

270
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,828
Don't get me wrong.
My business isn't with you lowlives.

271
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,090
Let go! You'll break my arm!

272
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,999
If you don't let go,
you'll be in big trouble!

273
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,665
I broke it.
Now, what kind of trouble am I in?

274
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,208
You bitch!

275
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,373
Stop it.

276
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,850
You're no match for her.

277
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:07,352
Bro...

278
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,580
Bro...
Bro Payatan...

279
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,745
Move.

280
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:14,315
You're Payatan? Your fame
has reached our kingdom as well.

281
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,190
Booze
Bartender, get me the usual.

282
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,656
Got it.

283
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,434
<i>Coffee Milk</i>

284
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,472
Listen, miss.

285
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,606
This is a place to drink and have fun.

286
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:38,716
If you have eyes as shiny as a sword,
you won't live very long in this village.

287
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:43,777
You should get out of this village
and confine yourself in some city.

288
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,319
It's for the best, but I guess
you didn't come here to talk after all.

289
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,095
Step outside.

290
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,266
Be my mascot, Payatan.

291
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,112
You'll have a successful future.

292
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,315
I'm not really good at serving people.

293
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:17,115
Well, grumbling about
this and that won't do anything.

294
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,984
If you want to make me your mascot,
defeat me. That's the rule.

295
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,320
Fine!

296
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,659
Princess Kneebar!

297
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,003
Paya.

298
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,363
Princess V1 Armlock!

299
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,170
Paya.

300
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,369
Princess Camel Clutch!

301
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,472
Paya.

302
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,887
Sorry, but my body is rather unique.

303
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,893
Every joint moves 360 degrees,
so submission holds won't work.

304
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,028
Somebody, contact her kingdom.

305
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,260
She won't be able to move
on her own for a while.

306
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,132
Don't think it's over yet.

307
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:13,009
I really like you now.
You'll make a perfect servant.

308
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,047
You're gonna die, miss.

309
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,483
Defeat is the same
as death in the royal family.

310
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,281
Princess Headlock!

311
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,684
Jeez, I thought you'd use some
amazing move, but a headlock?

312
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,594
It's nothing special,
and I'm disappointed.

313
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,100
A headlock is nothing
special? You're so naive.

314
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,169
What?

315
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,974
No way! He's in pain!

316
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:45,811
Impossible!

317
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:46,812
Impossible!
His head can smash huge rocks!

318
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,439
His head can smash huge rocks!

319
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,845
You should do your homework.

320
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,786
The skull has a juncture.
Which means it has a joint.

321
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:59,846
Headlocks use that to directly attack
the brain, a deadly submission hold.

322
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,222
It feels like someone's
grabbing my brain...

323
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,826
A champion uses submission holds.

324
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,900
There are no holds
that I can't master!

325
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,065
He's been beaten!

326
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,229
Let's flee!

327
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,305
Now, keep your promise.
Be my mascot.

328
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,103
You'll regret it...

329
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,876
When you sleep... When you eat...

330
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:30,244
I can promise you that
you'll never feel safe again!

331
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,085
I'm definitely going to kill you!

332
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,058
What's so funny?

333
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:45,235
If I can't handle one or two
servants who are after my life...

334
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,805
...how can I call myself royalty?

335
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,534
You're a strange princess.

336
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,304
Take out your mascot contract.

337
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:03,947
This life that I have...
I swear to serve you as long as I live.

338
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,098
We've been friends ever since, right?

339
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,156
We've been friends ever since, right?
Right?

340
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,790
Let's go to school!

341
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,300
Let's go, paya!

342
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,528
Let's go!

343
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,934
Go, paya!

344
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,532
They've gone through a lot,
but they get along now, so...

345
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,449
What's wrong, Tetsuko-chan?

346
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,144
What's wrong, Tetsuko-chan?
What is it, paya?

347
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,478
It's nothing!

348
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,177
He's after her!

349
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,721
He's still itching to kill her!

350
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,924
We're going to be late! Let's hurry!

351
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,186
Paya!

352
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,054
I didn't use any magic this time, did I?

353
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,190
You don't need any magic.

354
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,394
Oh, Anego-san. You're alive?

355
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,403
I'm not dead yet!

356
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,839
Hehe.

357
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,340
<i>To Be Continued</i>

358
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:22,332
<i>If you bend the knees upside down...</i>

359
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:29,837
<i>...even your belief about
crushing a rock becomes distorted.</i>

360
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:38,106
<i>Good, justice, and even the truth
is gone when you feel the pain.</i>

361
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:46,624
<i>Even those with fortitude have joints.</i>

362
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:54,631
<i>Take a look. This is
the submission of a monarch.</i>

363
00:23:54,833 --> 00:24:07,212
<i>As long as you
have fortitude, you will prosper.</i>

364
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,000
Next Magical Witch Punie-chan,
"Shocking Breakfast Strategy?"

365
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,537
"If a Little Cuckoo
Doesn't Chirp, Kill It!"

366
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:39,542
<i>"Oh, So Cute! Did You Know the
Chances of Having Twins Are 1l120?"</i>

367
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,703
Please look forward to it!
