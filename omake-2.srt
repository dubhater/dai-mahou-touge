00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,758
<i>Punie's Homecoming:</i>
<i>State of the Society</i>

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,965
So we're here in the land of magic!

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:13,942
Like its name suggests, this place is
filled with buildings out of fairy tales.

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,139
It's wonderful, right?

5
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:20,379
I'm jealous. I'd like
to live somewhere fun like...

6
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,113
Get him!

7
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,140
Punie-chan...

8
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,438
What is this place?

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,843
You can't do much
about economic inequality.

10
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:52,407
It can't be helped. If we don't exploit
them, the country can't stand.

11
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,649
Weird.

12
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,889
It normally passes right
through this area. Is it terrorism?

13
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:04,898
Terrorism?

14
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,661
Terrorism?
Divine punishment!

15
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,967
Why do you treat your people like this?

16
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,902
Why do you treat your people like this?
We'll be taking your life!

17
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,631
As I thought, terrorists.

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,733
I can't avoid this.
I'll take care of them with my magic.

19
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,644
They're so poor,
yet they have Anisakis shields!

20
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,707
With those around, my magical
attacks will be rendered useless.

21
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,447
My magic won't work, so...

22
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,516
I'll have to use submission holds!

23
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,353
Princess Manji Hold!

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,394
Princess Standing Neck Lock!

25
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,886
Princess Telephone Arm Lock!

26
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:42,230
Rioting over a little
oppression is uncalled for.

27
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:46,897
Say, is the land of magic
a dictatorship devastated by fascism?

28
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:50,464
We're almost at
the royal palace. Let's head on out!

29
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,477
I'm Punie, a magical princess.

30
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,383
The reason I came to
the world of humans is a secret.
