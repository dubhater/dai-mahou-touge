<i>Punie's Homecoming:</i>

00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:10,507
This is the Magic Forest. We're here
to hunt for matsutake mushrooms.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,546
Hey, Punie-chan, I don't
see any matsutake anywhere.

4
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,274
That's true.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,587
There. This way.

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,160
It's there?

7
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,066
Uniko-san!

8
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,368
Unio-san!

9
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:48,273
In the land of magic, matsutake
grows on a matsutake unicorn.

10
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,882
It can't be you're...

11
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,845
Didn't I say it's "matsutake hunting"?

12
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,059
You're the witch from that time!

13
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,224
Let go!

14
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,399
It hurts! It hurts!

15
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,103
Unio-san!

16
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,712
Unio-san!

17
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,049
Hang on, Unio-san!

18
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,719
I'll curse you till
the royal family's line ends!

19
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,188
I'll curse you!

20
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,889
That is the way of the proud unicorn.

21
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,529
I can't eat this matsutake...

22
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,405
I can't eat it!

23
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,908
But somehow my chopsticks are...

24
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,675
Delicious!
