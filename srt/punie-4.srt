12

<i>There's only one path that leads
to supremacy, and that is by fighting.</i>

13
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,631
Why, Punie Tanaka-kun?

14
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,800
Principal...

15
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,301
My time here on Earth is almost up.

16
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,174
While I'm here, I want to make
as many fun memories as I can...

17
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,988
You want to be on the sports
festival's executive committee?

18
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,119
I'm sorry if I sound too selfish...

19
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,329
I can't, right?

20
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,295
No problem!

21
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,031
Go and do your best!

27
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,652
What's the matter, Anego-san?
Hurry up and go to the gate.

28
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,197
Look at the executive committee.

29
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,867
The witch is smiling with
a perfectly straight face.

30
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:50,867
What?

31
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,199
You didn't know?

32
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:56,639
Every event for today's sports
festival is being produced by Punie.

33
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:02,009
This year's sports festival
is gonna get a little ugly.

34
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,412
Coming up is
the second-year girls' spoon race.

35
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,014
On your mark, paya.

36
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,214
Ready...

37
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,023
Bang!

38
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,491
Wow! Anego-san is really fast!

39
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,464
She's in first place!
She's far ahead of the others!

40
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,398
This is too easy...

41
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,938
These are eggs prepared by Punie.

42
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,543
It's possible. With her, anything is.

43
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,244
Excuse me.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,712
Freight train is connected.
Ready to go!

45
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,657
Hey!

46
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,023
Hey!
Choo-choo! Choo-choo!

47
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,022
Don't, Tetsuko! That egg...

48
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,495
The red team's
Tetsuko Koku is in first place!

49
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,326
I did it!

50
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,104
Maybe you're just
thinking too much, Anego.

51
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,840
A regular egg?

52
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:10,043

54
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,819
Don't tell me she'll do
this sports festival fair and square.

55
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:36,470
Go! Go! Red team!
Go! Go! Red team!

56
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,415
Big Sister!

57
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,154
Pyun, Potaru, what is it?

58
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,192
We made some lunch.

59
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,659
Let's eat.

60
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,627
Wow! Thank you.

61
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,322
Yay! Yay!

62
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,900
You delinquent women,
there's enough for you too.

63
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,300
You should be grateful, pig.

64
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,702
Thanks...

65
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,099
Bon appétit!

66
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,141
Wow! This is amazing!

67
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,237
They look good...

68
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,318
Aren't you going to eat?

69
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,251
Looks like they're not poisoned.

70
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,523
I'm a taste tester?

71
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,514
I'm a taste tester?
Hey, Big Sister!

72
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,253
We want to be
in the sports festival too!

73
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,226
Sure, that's fine.

74
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,527
You're sure?
It's dangerous for small kids.

75
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,631
It's my first time experiencing
something this wonderful.

76
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,399
I want to let them participate as well.

77
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,531
Trying to be a goody-goody...

78
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,475
You're planning to win
at the end with magic, right?

79
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,578
After becoming
an executive committee member...

80
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,244
...and researching
the sports festival, I understood.

81
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,949
There are many wonderful
cultures here on Earth.

82
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:01,390
I was about to head
home to the land of magic...

83
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,463
...without experiencing any of them.

84
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,726
Punie...

85
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,800
Anego-san.

86
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:13,064
The mock cavalry battle at the end...
Will you compete earnestly with me?

87
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,300
I won't use magic.
I'll compete fair and square.

88
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,944
I want to have
good memories with you.

89
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,787
I'm going to take
that bandana off your head.

90
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,825
I won't lose.

91
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:36,829

94
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,060
Goodness, the teams are tied.

95
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,934
Here comes the red team!

96
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:59,042
And now, here comes the white team!

97
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,784
Come on, Puni...

98
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,286
What?

99
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:02,789
<i>Punie</i>

100
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,756

101
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,780
Punie Cavalry!

102
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,260
The White Rose Squad is here!

103
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,722
You brought a real cavalry?

104
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,028
This is your first battle.
Look well at how your sister fights.

105
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,728
Yes, Big Sister!

106
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,302
Shout for victory!

107
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,953
Charge!

108
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,464
Anego, here they come!

109
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,125
Damn! Pull back! Retreat!

110
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,973
Come on, come on, come on!

111
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,375
I got him!

112
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,218
I-I did it, master!

113
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,554
Well done on the first strike.

114
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,246
A Godiva truffle!

115
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,223
I'm expecting you to do more.

116
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,295
Go and get more.
Respond with more action.

117
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,362
Yes, ma'am!

118
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,426
With great physical strength!

119
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:27,172
One after another, our army
is taking down the enemy.

120
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,071
Victory is only a matter of time.

121
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,534
So...

122
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,975
I see.

123
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,174
Huh? What's she doing?

124
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,581
She's definitely off guard.

125
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,454
Time to strike.

126
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,022
<i>Punie</i>

Start the horses!

Our enemies are on the athletic field!

130
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,697
Take the old traitor's head!

131

133
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,999
What?

134
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,678
T-They attacked our weak flank...

135
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,909
What? What about the reserves?

136
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,575
Pyun-dono and Potaru-dono
are rebelling against us!

137
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,019
Our army is getting defeated!

138
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,522
Stop fussing!

00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:24,229
Damn you...
You backstabbed your sister!

141
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,523
First and second troops, flank right!

142
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,602
Join the third troop
and create a circle formation!

143
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,136
Attack both sides!

144
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,332
You delinquent woman,
you should give yourself up.

145
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,800
What? Punie's army
seems to be in disarray.

146
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,276
Guys, now!

147
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,585
Don't think you're better than us...

148
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,251
...just because you're on a horse!

149
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,254
Why you!

150
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,220
That's dangerous!

151
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,945
How many allies survived?

152
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,205
It is only you and myself, master.

153
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:24,187
There's no escape for you now.
You used such a dirty trick...

154
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,948
Get ready.

155
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:26,992
Paya!

156
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:33,666

00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,928
Payatan!
Please flee!

158
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,093
Let me handle this!

159
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,865
I'll see you again
at the river of the dead!

160
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,866
Payatan! Payatan!

161
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,665
I'm sorry, Payatan... It's all my fault...

162
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,875
After her! Don't let the witch escape!

163
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:23,571
I guess the era of
close combat has already ended...

164
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,050
From now on...

165
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,277
From now on...

166
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,090
...it's the era of guns.

167
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,495
Muskets!

168
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,857
Fire!

169
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,333
Next!

170
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,867
Fire!

171
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,910
Afterwards, this battle...

172
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:08,221
...became known as the first time
guns were used in battle in Japan.

173
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:12,593
It marked its place in
the history of sports festivals.

174
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:17,197
This was already
a major event anyway...

175
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,100
Take that! Take that!

176
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,036
Bad girls!

177
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,372
Take that! Take that!

178
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,241
I baked the cupcakes, Potaru.

179
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,344
Looks delicious!

180
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,251
I made it to this recipe,
but I wonder if I did it right.

181
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,522
Bon appétit!

182
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:15,992
Wow!

183
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,460
Delicious.

184
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,636
Here it comes!

185
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,867
It worked, Potaru.

186
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,273
We'll get Big Sister with this...

187
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,286
<i>Episode 8:
We Can't Just Stay the Way We Are.</i>

188
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,288
<i>It's Kind of Scary
Becoming an Adult.</i>

189
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,584
Good morning,
Anego-san, Tetsuko-chan!

190
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,625
Paya!

191
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,461
Yo.

192
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,122
Yo.
Morning, Punie-chan.

193
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,323
It's another lovely day.

194
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,602
Huh? What's going on?

195
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,070
Gorgeous.

196
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,878
I can't control myself anymore!

197
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,920
They're pretty.

198
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,645
Are they celebrities?

199
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,656
Maybe a photo shoot?

200
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:23,626
I'm jealous. I wish I were like them.

201
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:29,099
Don't worry, Tetsuko-chan. You have
boobs that are like a super bullet train.

202
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,327
You think?

203
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,734
Let's go. We'll be late.

204
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,798
Oh, so you'll just pass right by us?

205
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,878
Big Sister...

206
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,405
Big Sister?

207
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,851
Don't tell me you two...

208
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,519
...are Pyun and Potaru?

209
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,882
How did you become adults?

210
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,324
We saw the "Book of the Dead"
on a Yahoo auction.

211
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,362
And that book had
an arcana of growth.

212
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,124
Big Sister... No, turd-Punie...

213
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,964
Do you know
why we couldn't beat you?

214
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,033
Oh? I wonder what's wrong?

215
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,270
She's shaking like an innocent girl.

216
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,603
She knows.

217
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:19,480
The reason why
we couldn't beat this delinquent...

218
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,986
...is because we were little!

219
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,453
Princess Gemini Monkey Flip!

220
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,327
Punie-chan!

221
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,191
Punie-chan!
Punie!

222
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,422
Gemini Knee Drop!

223
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,396
Gemini Drop Kick!

224
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,268
Gemini Pile Driver!

225
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,430
Gemini Hell Strike!

226
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,781
Gemini...

227
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,975
...Guillotine!

228
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,952
They're strong!

229
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,594
Their magical and
physical power is greater.

230
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,962
They're undoubtedly
the strongest foes.

231
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,867
This is bad! This is bad!

232
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,374
My lovely daughters
are killing each other!

233
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,910
Ouch! My stomach...

234
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,136
Darling.

235
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,147
Do you know why I was
able to become the queen?

236
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,811
Because you're the strongest
witch in the land of magic.

237
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,686
Not at all.

238
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:38,192
There were many witches
whom were stronger than me.

239
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,664
Akko, Sally, Meg...

240
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,632
And Momo.

241
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,305
The reason I was
able to become queen...

242
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,210
...is because I kept beating those
whom were stronger than me.

243
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:03,711
In order to become the queen, you
need strength plus something else.

244
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,928
This is bad...

245
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,364
I don't think I can win...

246
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,798
We'll forget what you
did to us, rotten punk.

247
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,962
We won't take time
beating you to death.

248
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,939
We'll kill you quickly, ugly bitch.

249
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,471
Listen to yourselves...

250
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,978
I can't believe
you're showing me mercy...

251
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:37,178
With your powers, you can
kill me and Queen Esmeralda...

252
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,985
...and have the land of magic
in the palm of your hands.

253
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,555
But after that...

254
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,355
...which one will be the queen?

255
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,164
Only one can.

256
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,407
It doesn't matter!

257
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,144
Only one of us
will profit from this, Potaru.

258
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,520
You can kill me and Pyun
at the same time now, Potaru.

259
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,881
What's wrong, Pyun?

260
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:14,893
Nothing...

261
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,417
Nothing...
She did it.

262
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,156
She's a scary individual, as usual.

263
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,322
How so?

264
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,593
The twin attacks...

265
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,262
Which part do you think
is most problematic?

266
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,400
The high-spirited combo play.

267
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,433
But look now.

268
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,640
With a word or two, she placed
doubt into the twins' minds.

269
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,410
Now they can't use combo play.

270
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,350
Crafty!

271
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,351
Unprincesslike craftiness.

272
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,086
Could she be the true witch?

273
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,592
Payatan?

274
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,257
Interesting.

275
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,733
You're definitely interesting.

276
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,436
I, Payatan, will follow
you to the depths of hell.

277
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,872
Don't be overwhelmed.

278
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,608
Submission holds
are meant for one-on-one combat.

279
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,711
That choke sleeper
before proved it, right?

280
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,085
That certainly is the greatest
weakness of submission holds.

281
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:23,420
But I've been practicing how to fight
one on two for the last eight years.

282
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,424
Eight years ago?

283
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,694
Wait a minute!
We're only eight years old!

284
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:29,923
That means...

285
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,731
When we were born into this world...

286
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,432
You were ready to fight both of us?

287
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,202
That's right.

288
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,473
I came up with this technique
in order to fight you twins.

289
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,242
In other words, it's sisterly love.

290
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,950
Accept your sister's love!

291
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,166
Princess...

292
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,665
No!

293
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,226
...Spinning Toe Hold!

294
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,183
The finish.

295
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,493
Princess Forty-four Magnum!

296
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,136
We were wrong! We should've...

297
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,832
...never made her our enemy!

298
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,635
Huh?

299
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,713
The arcana's effects wore off.

300
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,244
I won't forgive you
just because it wore off.

301
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,717
Big Sister...

302
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,351
Your punishment is just beginning.

303
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,021
Punie-chan, please forgive them!

304
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,928
I won't forgive you!

305
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,796
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

306
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,597
Punie-chan...

307
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:30,219
Looks like the land of magic
will be peaceful for a while...

308
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,250
The End

309
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:59,249
<i>If you bend the knees upside down...</i>

310
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:06,890
<i>...even your belief about
crushing a rock becomes distorted.</i>

311
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:15,023
<i>Good, justice, and even the truth
is gone when you feel the pain.</i>

312
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:23,541
<i>Even those with fortitude have joints.</i>

313
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:31,548
<i>Take a look. This is
the submission of a monarch.</i>

314
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:44,187
<i>As long as you
have fortitude, you will prosper.</i>
