00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,268
<i>Punie's Homecoming:</i>
<i>Civilization</i>

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,902
Punie-chan,
what's the land of magic like?

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,735
Shall we go there?

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:12,141
Lyrical Tokarev, kill them all!

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,316
Let's take the Metro
Magic Line to the castle!

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:25,824
A tram in the land of magic!
I wonder what powers this thing?

7
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,256
The first light in ten years... Save us...

8
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,757
Punie-chan, that was...

9
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,497
The tram's slow, so let's
take the Magic Southern Central.

10
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:44,376
There's no pantograph line.
Does it get power from a third rail?

11
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,011
I'm gonna die... Let me off...

12
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,784
Punie-chan,
does the land of magic run on...

13
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,451
Oh, the Magical
Government Office building!

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,528
Don't change the subject!
