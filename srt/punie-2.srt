Sure.

Don't ever call me that again!
Give me the right of succession!

57
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,634
Punie-chan.

58
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,437
Succession? Is she
an assassin from the land of magic?

59
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,339
Royal authority is sacred.
I can't give it to you.

Looks like we can't
settle it with magic.

67
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,852
Then...

68
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,727
We'll have to use physical attacks!

69
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,342

70
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,419
Punie-chan!

71
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,730
She did it.

72
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:32,150
Punie is good. Every one of
her moves can take me down.

73
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:37,286
If she gets a good grip, my joints
will be bent in awkward directions!

74
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:43,866
Amazing... That lady
is fighting toe to toe with Punie.

75
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,200
Come on, Punie-chan!

76
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,742

is your greatest weakness.

78
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,116

79
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,141
She got her!
You fell for it!

80
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,641
A dummy!

81
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:13,828
Those cuffs have the magic-inhibiting
mark of the evil god Anisakis.

82
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,764
Looks like you can't use your magic
or your submission holds, Punie.

83
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,031
Stop!

84
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,177
Why are you doing
such a cruel thing?

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,748
It's not right to take
the throne by force!

86
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,945
This isn't right?

87
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,312
You've misunderstood!

88
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:39,880
The Tanaka family is
the one who usurped the throne!

89
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:48,560
My father, King Barbaroque, was
a wise monarch loved by his people.

90
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,638

of Saint Magical Kingdom!

95
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,185
What? That can't be!

96
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,654
Punie-chan, say something!

97
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,160
Your father was incompetent,
so he was overthrown.

98
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,366
What?

99
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,663
What?
Punie-chan!

100
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,559
As a matter of fact,
you should be grateful.

101
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,662
Since he was
thrown out instead of beheaded.

102
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:08,237
The king was incompetent, so he's
having a hard time getting a job.

103
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,982
He goes to the Hello Work
hiring office daily...

104
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,882
...and Mother does housework
and makes fake flowers.

105
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:19,890
We're in such needy circumstances,
and our lives are like hell itself.

106
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,557
Now it's your family's turn to suffer!

107
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,236
Not good, not good.

108
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,330
Punie's in big trouble!

109
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,375
What should I do? What should I do?

110
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,637
Please calm down, honey.

111
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,337
Yes, but...

112
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,812
If she has trouble
defeating such a foe...

113
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,852
...then she's unworthy
of being my successor.

114
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,298
Die!

115
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,305
Did you think
handcuffs could restrain me?

116
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:12,701
Shut up!

117
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,372

118
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,781
You've misunderstood
the meaning of a legitimate monarch.

119
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,619
You have to claim
the throne with power!

120
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,829
Shut your mouth, little girl!
You're still handcuffed, you know!

121
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,925
So you think it's
over if I'm handcuffed?

122
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,693
Silly.

123
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,938
Such a thing in the 4,000-year
history of submission holds...

124
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,556
It's over.

We're sorry!

178
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,418
I have to go to school, so stay
at the Punie house and behave.

179
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,054
Okay...

180
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,197
That's not like you.
Letting them go after a spanking.

181
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,740
Oh, really?

182
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:42,205
It was too easy. They say even lions
are serious when hunting rabbits.

183
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,947
Of course I'm serious...

184
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,450
...when I hunt.

185
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,086
Like I thought. You're vicious, Punie.

186
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:58,029
We came for her head,
but we ended up really embarrassed.

187
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,998
We won't let her get away
with this! That goby witch!

188
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,236
I'm Payatan!

189
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,504
Hey, fake mammal!

190
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,006
Come here for a second.

191
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,706
What is it, paya?

192
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,943
Are you giving me
something good to eat, paya?

193
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,956
We're the only ones here, Payatan.

194
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,926
Or should I say
Colonel Paya Livingston?

195
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,025
What is this about?

196
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,969
Abandon our sister
and become our mascot.

197
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,540
We'll guarantee you'll succeed in life.

198
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,633
Oh, jeez. Not that story again...

199
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:57,151
Come up with a better story next time.

200
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,526
See you.

201
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,493
See you.
Wait!

202
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,227
You think you can get away
by turning your back to us?

203
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,026
Listen, little girls.

204
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,465
Punie might be nice to you...

205
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,831
...but I'm not nice at all.

206
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,931
A pet with a bad mouth like that.

207
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,771
I'm disappointed, Potaru.

208
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,711
You're right, Pyun.
I thought he'd make a good mascot.

209
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,808
Let's go find another one.

210
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,917
Those rings! Don't tell me...

211
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,857
S-Stop!

212
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,159
They're foul-mouthed,
but your sisters are cute.

213
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:46,101
Right. They're much younger,
so I adore them very much.

214
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,105
I end up pampering them.

215
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,231
Let's go!

216
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,607
I heard the sound of a carriage.

217
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,374
Let's go!

218
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,050
Payatan!

219
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,217
P-Punie-sama, be careful...

220
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,323
Payatan...

221
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,954
Those girls...

222
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,257
Those girls have in their hands...

223
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,333
Payatan!

224
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,617
Pyun... Potaru...

225
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,653
I think I'm a little angry now.

226
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,228
We're already angry.

227
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,268
You embarrassed us
so many times in the past.

228
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,471
We can't go on
without getting our revenge!

229
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,701
That's the royal family's
class-A magic equipment...

230
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,439
The Ring of the Immoral!

231
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,711
Lyrical Tokarev, destroy everything!

232
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,822
What happened?

233
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,535
I am Zephel Yetzler.

234
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,431
A wandering soul with no master.

235
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,599
He's trouble, paya...

236
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,939
He's one of the oldest gods
from before mythical times...

237
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,939
He's unbelievably strong, paya...

238
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,457
What now?

239
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,693
Magic is ineffective
against a god, idiot.

240
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:02,297
Since he's that big, you can't use
your submission holds, loser.

241
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,475
Give us the right of succession
and we'll spare you, filthy punk.

242
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:10,708
On your knees.
Cry and beg for your life, you bitch.

243
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,517
That's all you have to say?

244
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,711
What?

245
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,087
Say everything you're thinking.

246
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,886
Because they'll be your last words.

247
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,154
Pyun, don't hesitate.
This is one of her usual dirty tricks.

248
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,699
She can't possibly win against a god.

249
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,392
Yeah, you're right.

250
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,366
Zephel, get rid of that insidious witch!

251
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,347
I told you before.

252
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,323
A champion uses submission holds.

253
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,829
He did it!

254
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,199
There's no submission
hold that won't work!

255
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,407
Princess Figure-four Fingerlock!

256
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,472
Give up?

257
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,948
No! No!

258
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,541
Come on!

259
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,188
You're that witch from back then!

260
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,061
Long time no see, Zephel Yetzler.

261
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,298
Spare me!

262
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:48,072
Punie-chan,
what did you do to that god?

263
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,281
Now...

264
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,178
Pyun, Potaru...

265
00:20:55,287 --> 00:21:00,987
If you do this again, I'll keep applying
submission holds again and again...

266
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,154
...till your flesh and bones turn to dust.

267
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,821
We're sorry!

268
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,565
As long as you understand.
I'll make you some pancakes.

269
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,536
Yay! Yay! Yay!

270
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,363
I really like your pancakes!

271
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,634
And honey?

272
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,233
Of course. I'll pour plenty of it.

273
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,242
Yay!

274
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,007
Fear the land of magic...

275
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:33,647
You're getting closer to becoming
a weak character like me.

276
00:21:53,412 --> 00:22:01,251
<i>If you bend the knees upside down...</i>

277
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,858
<i>...even your belief about
crushing a rock becomes distorted.</i>

278
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:17,025
<i>Good, justice, and even the truth
is gone when you feel the pain.</i>

279
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:25,543
<i>Even those with fortitude have joints.</i>

280
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:33,550
<i>Take a look. This is
the submission of a monarch.</i>

281
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:46,222
<i>As long as you
have fortitude, you will prosper.</i>

282
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:10,018
Next, "Can You Decide
Someone's Value with Test Scores?"

283
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,989
"I'm Probably a Zero Anyway.
That's Right."

284
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,185
"When I Saw You Sweep Back
Your Bangs Under the Apple Tree...

285
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:21,129
...with the Flower-comb in Your Hair,
I Thought You Were a Flower Too."
