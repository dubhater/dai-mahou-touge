00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,769
<i>Magical Witch Punie- chan</i>

2
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,880
<i>Spin that Princess Rod.</i>

3
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,116
<i>She has descended
from the land of magic.</i>

4
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,579
<i>Spin that magical stick.</i>

5
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,680
<i>Pleased to meet you, Punie Tanaka.</i>

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:31,353
<i>Lightning, sweep, exterminate,
use your powers and rule the world.</i>

7
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:36,299
<i>Don't trust those kind
words and nice smiles.</i>

8
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:45,474
<i>Lyrical Tokarev, kill them all.</i>

9
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:52,412
<i>I will take you to the land of paradise.</i>

10
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:58,749
<i>Lyrical Tokarev, kill them all.</i>

11
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:07,664
<i>There's only one way
to survive, and that is to fight.</i>

12
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:26,277
<i>There's only one path that leads
to supremacy, and that is by fighting.</i>

13
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,825
We have midterms
starting today. How depressing.

14
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,022
I envy you, Tetsuko.
You're an honors student.

15
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,894
That's not true.

16
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,933
Oh, I can't wait for the exams.

17
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,204
Shall I show you
how much I've studied?

18
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:50,436
What? You'll show it to
us here, paya? What a waste, paya.

19
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,136
Studied?

20
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,974
Here we go!

21
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,416
2x2. 2x3. 2x4.

22
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,180
2x2. 2x3. 2x4.
4. 6. 8.

23
00:01:59,285 --> 00:01:59,886
2x5. 2x6. 2x7. 2x8.

24
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,617
2x5. 2x6. 2x7. 2x8.
10. 12. 14. 16.

25
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,357
2x9.

26
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,688
2x9.
1...

27
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:09,896
18!

28
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,124
18!
You're amazing!

29
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,461
You mastered this section, paya!

30
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,433
That's like elementary-school level.

31
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,604
They can't go up to sixth level...

32
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:24,370
That's equivalent to the land of
magic's old-emperor level, paya!

33
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,308
You must be...

34
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,737
...stupid.

35
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:28,548
No! Don't say that!

36
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,650
<i>Stupid
No! Don't say that!</i>

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,619
<i>Episode 5: Can You Decide
Someone's Value with Test Scores?</i>

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,120
<i>'m Probably a Zero Anyway.
That's Right.</i>

39
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:41,519
This is hilarious. The princess
from the land of magic is an idiot.

40
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,730
Will you be okay, Punie-chan?

41
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,274
If you do poorly on these
midterms, you'll repeat the grade.

42
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,105
Don't worry. I've taken care of it.

43
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,577
Ouch!

44
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,149
Class is already in session.

45
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,650
Quiet. Put away everything
but your writing implements.

46
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,288
G-Gesomi!
What happened to Tateno-sensei?

47
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,331
Gesomi?

48
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,266
Tateno-sensei is
absent due to an injury.

49
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,167
Is there a problem
with me being in charge?

50
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,569
This is bad.

51
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,303
If it was that old fart Tateno,
we could've cheated easily...

52
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,304
Hey, what is Gesomi-sensei like?

53
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,649
That's right. You just transferred
here, so you don't know.

54
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,448
She devotes her life
to finding cheaters.

55
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,685
She expelled many in the past.
I'd say she's extremely sadistic!

56
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,821
Don't even think about cheating.

57
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,493
Devoting her life
to such a stupid thing...

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,897
Now, begin.

59
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,300
Anego.

60
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,979
What should we do?

61
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,812
At this rate, we'll all repeat the grade.

62
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,819
Anego...

63
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,218
Anego...
I know!

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,084
Don't take your eyes off
Gesomi no matter what.

65
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,216
We can catch her off guard,
even for an instant.

66
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,657
Right.

67
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,596
Now!

68
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,644
Such an old trick...

69
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,115
Isn't there anyone out there?

70
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,551
Cheaters with unique methods
to present a serious challenge.

71
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,392
Get up, you rotten oranges.

72
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,137
I'll give you another chance.

73
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,109
Next time, try to cheat in
a way that will actually excite me.

74
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,074
That is...

75
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:18,514
...if you have a brain
inside that head of yours.

76
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,310
We're not oranges!

77
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,323
We're human beings!

78
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,291
We're human beings!
That's right!

79
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,986
Oh my. You're rotten, but you
can still say nasty things.

80
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,964
What'd you say?

81
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,059
Jeez, Anego-san
gets excited very easily.

82
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,432
What'd you say?

83
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,200
Now's my chance. Come on out.

84
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,576
Understood.

85
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,670
Worry not, Punie-dono.

86
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:53,377
We studied all night and
mastered the essence of academics.

87
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,818
Those are the veggies from the curry!

88
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,919
Punie-chan's going to let those
manservants do all the cheating.

89
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,731
This is math, Punie-dono?

90
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,897
Right. Hurry up.

91
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,511
Punie-dono, are you aware of this?

92
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,416
What?

93
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,250
We're vegetables given
life by the power of magic.

94
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,082
Temporary puppets.

95
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:34,826
And so our skills can't be greater
than the one who gave us life.

96
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,995
You can't go beyond my skills?

97
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,197
N-No...

98
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,133
That's right. I am loath
to say this, but this problem...

99
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,838
...is gibberish to me.

100
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,140
What?

101
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,465
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,176
You're useless.

103
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,878
S-Since it has turned to this,
I will commit hara-kiri!

104
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,415
Potato-dono!

105
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,452
I will atone for my sin by killing myself!

106
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,885
This is for Punie-dono!

107
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,149
Hold it!

108
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,519
Let go!

109
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,652
No, I won't! Death isn't
the only thing for vegetables!

110
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,663
I'm begging you! For pity's sake!

111
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,491
Shut up.

112
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,094
If your suicide could keep me from
being left back, then I needn't suffer.

113
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,364
Is something wrong?

114
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,305
It's nothing.

115
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,643
You people, come
to the detention room later.

116
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,777
Why you... Just wait.

117
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,290
I'm exhausted...

118
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,742
To my loyal vegetables...

119
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:05,544
This deep situation with the exam,
after looking at my current state...

120
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:11,146
We must resort to an emergency
measure and keep control of events.

121
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,855
Punie-sama...

122
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,853
The time is 10:20, and this
plan will come to an end.

123
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:23,265
It's very unfortunate, but we're
going to give up on this exam.

124
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,497
You can return
to being normal vegetables.

125
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,966
Then you'll repeat the grade?

126
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,976
I will not.

127
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:37,246
Lyrical Tokarev, kill them all!

128
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:50,395
I can't let them find out the princess
from the land of magic is stupid.

129
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,593
If they were to find out...
If they were to find out...

130
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:00,602
I'm going to blow up this planet
and take everyone with me!

131
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,506
That's a Magical A-weapon!

132
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,174
Don't, Punie! If you let that explode...

133
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:15,880
...it'll turn everything in a radius
of one hundred to smithereens!

134
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,658
You're willing to choose
death over failing an exam?

135
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,871
I haven't teamed up
with you since Vietnam.

136
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:39,411
Hurry, paya! It's possible
Punie-chan will jump the gun, paya!

137
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,477
Don't worry. No problem.

138
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,880
Leave it to Peter.

139
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,284
That school, right?

140
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,024
George!

141
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:07,663
Bill! Ronald! Jimmy! Richard!

142
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,503
Abraham!

143
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,707
What? What's going on?

144
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,878
You okay? You're not that hurt!

145
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,948
Hang in there!

146
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,887
Why is it so dark?
Is this the new Tanna Tunnel?

147
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,453
The prototype is passing
Gifu-Hashima Station.

148
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,033
Where do I get off?

149
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,933
Where do I get off?
Medic! Medic!

150
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,467
This looks bad.
Let's try to get her out of here.

151
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,634
R-Right.

152
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:50,140
There's a bullet train stationed every
30 minutes at Annakaharuna Station...

153
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,047
Hang on! That's just a delusion!

154
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,579
Hey!

155
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:12,695

Good job, paya! Let's flee, paya!

160
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,624
Aye aye, sir!

161
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,968
That was close, paya.
It was about to turn ugly, paya.

162
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,405
Payatan.

163
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,770
What is it, paya?

164
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,845
Can you come back to
the squad, Colonel Paya Livingston?

165
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,375
Squad?

166
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,849
The squad, huh?

167
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,130
Let's not talk about that.

168
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,334
I'm just a magical girl's mascot now.

169
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,608
Colonel...

170
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,943
Sorry about that!

171
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,908
Forget it!

172
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,014
Okay, paya! I'll forget, paya!

173
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,453
What was that?

174
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,265
Don't tell me someone
used the army to cheat...

175
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,028
Oh my.

176
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,670
That's it, folks!
Pass up your papers from the back.

177
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,975
Who could take a test this way!

178
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,976
Something's wrong with you, Gesomi!

179
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,636
Yeah! Yeah!

180
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,216
That's too bad...

181
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,481
Even though you're stupid,
I'll still be your friend.

182
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,216
It was Punie, all right.

183
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,348
She got a zero...

184
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,952
...but she didn't get left back
due to good overall marks.

185
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,088
Happy ending indeed.

186
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,739
Good morning, Anego-san.

187
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,004
We've met every morning lately.

188
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,241
Y-Yeah, that's true.

189
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,052
We'll be late if we don't hurry. Later.

190
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,654
Hey, Yamada...

191
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,425
What the hell.
I can't believe a person like me...

192
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,124
...would fall in love.

193
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,734
But falling in love isn't my thing.

194
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,103
If they found out,
I wonder what everyone would say.

195
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,376
I have to make sure
no one finds out...

196
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,215
I found a great toy.

197
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,354
Paya.

198
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,619

00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,057
<i>with the Flower-comb in Your Hair,
I Thought You Were a Flower Too...</i>

200
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,389
Hey, confessed to Yamada yet?

201
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,862
Come here!

202
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,231
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

203
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,831
Of course not.

204
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:41,743
You have strong feelings for him.
Why would I go tell others about it?

205
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,580
Do you know?

206
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,450
What?

207
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,941
What?
About Anego-san and Yamada-kun...

208
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,086
Can't help that it's out.

209
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,955
That's right. I'm in love.

210
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,794
That's wonderful!

211
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,865
But it won't work.
I've already given up.

212
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,125
Why?

213
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,826
I'm the leader
who's in control of this area.

214
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,634
But compared to me,
he was brought up sheltered.

215
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,233
He has a good personality,
and everyone loves him.

216
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,472
We're like night and day. It won't work.

217
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:21,486
Oh, but those are the types of
people that tend to be insidious.

218
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,045
A brute and a hussy.
You'll make a great couple.

219
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,352
Don't base things on your values!

220
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,917
Anyway, I decided not to get
too deep. Leave me alone.

221
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,622
That's really okay?

222
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:33,959
You're annoying.

223
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:38,503
Feeling nervous when confessing...
Feeling excited waiting for the reply...

224
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,062
But when they turn you down,
you become very sad.

225
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:46,702
I think those are special
privileges that only girls have.

226
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:47,836
Punie...

227
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,676
Here, take this.

228
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,678
I'm sorry about before.
Punie-chan is right.

229
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,745
You can have this. I won this from
Monthly Railroad Fan magazine.

230
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,721
Amusement park tickets!

231
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:03,625
That's right.
You should ask if he wants to go.

232
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,923
Well, but...

233
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,526
Come on!

234
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,462
Go! Go!

235
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,042
Hey, Anego-san. What is it?

236
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,674
Oh, well...

237
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,287
Um, do you have
any plans this weekend?

238
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,419
No, I'm free. Why?

239
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,585
I understand if you don't want to...

240
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:40,222
...but I got these tickets
for an amusement park.

241
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,527
Would you like to go with me?

242
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,726
Sure.

243
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,860
Really?

244
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,803
I've been wanting
to go there for a while.

245
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,678
My good friends!

246
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,447
You did it, Anego-san!

247
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,813
I'm sorry about
before, Punie, Tetsuko.

248
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,749
Have a great time.

249
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,628
He's running late.

250
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,204
Yeah.

251
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,370
I can hear Punie's voice!

252
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,875
Huh? Something's in my ear.

253
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,742
We'll advise you
from behind the scenes.

254
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,315
Good luck, Anego-san!

255
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,146
Good luck, Anego-san!
I don't need your help!

256
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,244
Oh? Who do you think
made this date possible?

257
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,418
Hey, here he comes.

258
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,014
Left! Left!

259
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,859
Sorry about that!

260
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,160
Sorry I'm late. Wait long?

261
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,291
No, not at all.

262
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,969
She said she didn't wait.

263
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,029
She said she didn't wait.
She came an hour early too.

264
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,276
I'll kill them...
I'll kill them later for sure...

265
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,540
Mouse Land

266
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,908
What should we ride first?

267
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,382
Let's see...

268
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,646
How about the roller coaster?

269
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,687
Good idea.

270
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:14,020
Go and tell him. Say you
want to ride the roller coaster.

271
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,252
Come on!

272
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,885
I have no say in this?

273
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:26,163
If they enjoy plenty of thrills, their bond
will become stronger than ever.

274
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,135
Really?

275
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,704
But somehow,
this doesn't look thrilling at all...

276
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,341
I know!

277
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,747
Lyrical Tokarev, kill them all!

278
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:46,246
Spirits, provide
more thrills for Anego-san!

279
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,621
I'm really scared of things like this.

280
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,255
I'm perfectly fine.
I'm not scared at all...

281
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,038
This kind of feels too high...

282
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,663
I was a fool.
I should've never listened to her.

283
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,361
This is a strange amusement park.

284
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,938
Hey, should we go there now?

285
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,436
We're going already?

286
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm begging you, Punie.
Leave us alone...

287
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,047
What are you saying?
The real fun begins here.

288
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:47,052
You're on an amusement-park
date, so you have to go there.

<i>Mansion of Fear</i>

290
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,515
Wow, a mansion of fear.
Sounds good.

291
00:19:55,961 --> 00:20:01,228
Holding each other out of fear
of the dark... And while they're at it...

292
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,564
What are you trying
to make me say, Punie-chan?

293
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,763
Oh, stop it!

294
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:14,107
I prepared the greatest terror of all.
I'll make you regret ever being born.

295
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,011
If it's man-made, it's not scary at all...

296
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,448
...but if it's Punie,
who knows what could happen?

297
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,020
This is bad. I want to go home...

298
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,426
Are you trembling?

299
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,189
Are you trembling?
N-No way!

300
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,229
Don't worry. I'm here by your side.

301
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,593
Let's go!

302
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,093
I-I-I'm holding hands with him!

303
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,803
Thank you, Punie!

304
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,843
It's so dark that I can't see anything.

305
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,227
I'm kind of nervous.

306
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,379
The highway?

307
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,610
Anego-san, how do
you like the mansion of fear?

308
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,345
I don't know...

309
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,916
The bloodcurdling
terror I prepared for you...

310
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:38,827
It's a drive on the metropolitan
highway, and the driver is...

311
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,663
...a car-manga-influenced, newly
licensed idiot who thinks he can drive!

312
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,997
Don't worry! Really!
I'm really dangerous!

313
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,043
I'm really good at driving!
I'm really dangerous!

314
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,136
Idiot! Eyes on the road!

315
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,478
They are!
I'll never get into an accident!

316
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,175
You're annoying!

317
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,953
Yeah! This is such a great feeling!

318
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,955
I'll do the counter!

319
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,767
Wow, I'm drifting! This can't be real!

320
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,733
You're spinning, idiot!

No, that's reverse. I'm not even
